FLEX SENSOR:
A flex sensor which is also known as bend sensor helps in measuring the amount of deflection or bending with a sensor. 
This sensor is stuck on a surface and resistance of sensor element is varied by bending the surface i.e. resistance is directly proportional to the amount of bend. 
These are based on resistive carbon elements, as a variable printed resistor, the flex sensor achieves great form factor on a thin flexible substrate. 
When this substrate is bend, an output resistance is produced that is correlated to the bend radius by the sensor. Thus the smaller the radius ,the higher resistive value is 
produced. A flex sensor has a range from about ~10K to ~35K which means it wonâ€™t return a full 0-5 volt range.

CODE:
int flex1=A0;
int flex2=A1;

void setup{	
pinMode(flex1, INPUT);
	pinMode(flex2,INPUT);
	pinMode(D6,OUTPUT);
	serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop{
int val1,val2;
val1= analogRead(flex1);
val2=analogRead(flex2);

if((flex1>700 && flex1<900) && (flex2<700 ))
{
	digitalWrite(D6,HIGH);
	delay(500);
	digitalWrite(D6,LOW);
	delay(500);
}
	else if((flex1<700)&&(flex2>700 && flex2<900))
	{
		digitalWrite(D6,HIGH);
	delay(500);
	digitalWrite(D6,LOW);
	delay(500);
		digitalWrite(D6,HIGH);
	delay(500);
	digitalWrite(D6,LOW);
	delay(500);
}

else if((flex1>700 && flex2<900) && (flex2>700 && flex2<900))
{
	digitalWrite(D6,HIGH);
}
else 
 {
	digitalWrite(D6,LOW);
}
}


  else if((flex1>700 && flex2<900) && (flex2>700 && flex2<900))
  {
    digitalWrite(D6,HIGH);
  }
  else
  {
    digitalWrite(D6,LOW);
  }
